# Twitter Clone

This is a simulated Twitter web page that allows users to compose and publish their own tweets, as well as view tweets from other users. However, the page does not have a sign-up or login function, so users are unable to follow or connect with each other. All tweets are publicly visible to anyone who visits the page. (The application was deployed using Heroku, but had to be taken down due to Heroku no longer providing a free version of their service.)
